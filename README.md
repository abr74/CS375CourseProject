CODE NINJAS - 2D PIXEL SURVIVOR GAME - CS 375 COURSE PROJECT

1. Besides the general "npm" setup utilized in class for local hosting, be sure to have
axios installed for the weather API to work smoothly:

      npm install axios

3. The main branch should have the latest functioning version

4. There are additional branches that the fly.io deployment generated on its own which do not pertain to the code

5. The combined pathing and collision branch also works and should have all the functionality besides the deployment logic

6. In the event of bugs in main & combined pathing/collision, the backup branch has relatively up-to-date funcitonality

7. PLEASE NOTE THAT the collision logic is designed to make the game more difficult, the coin can only be collected when the character
   and coin sprites meet at their direct centers. In other words, you may think coins are no being collected, but they actually need perfect collision
